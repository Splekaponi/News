Sir Tamayo taught the students the basics of editorial cartooning and showed them some examples of editorial cartoons. The second session was on editorial writing. Sir Tamayo again led this session, teaching the students how to write editorials. The third and final session was on column writing, where Sir Tamayo taught the students the purpose of and how to write columns. “As a Grade 8 SPJ student, I was truly impressed and enjoyed Sir Tamayo\'s seminar. His talents across various fields left me amazed,” shared Veenuz Lei Bumaltao, an SPJ student. Another student, Andrei Miguel Balmonte, added, “Sir Tamayo gave an in-depth analysis on editorial writing and is helping me improve my journalistic skills.” This campus journalism seminar-workshop was a valuable experience for the students of PCNHS.

Considering the regular class sessions, it made room for an additional special session to be set aside just for the teaching staff as it aimed at giving an inspirational, physical, and psychological healing celebration. Fun and meaningful activities filled the day: pampering and entertainment were fused. Teachers were given free whole-body massages courtesy of the Philippine Association of Licensed Massage Therapists Baguio-Benguet Chapter headed by Emilia Taguiling Latogan. Beadwork jewelry-making workshops provided a creative outlet for the teachers, while carnival-style games like draw lots for teacher freebies and an online &#34;Guess Who&#34; game gave everyone a dose of fun. The most touching experience was probably the &#34;Teacher for a Day&#34; activity wherein students became the teachers in a merry play of roles, indicating their respect for the often-neglected duties of their teachers. A serenade was also conducted for appreciation for teachers, administrators, and staff, each having received heartfelt tokens. To celebrate their special day, teachers deserve to be pampered and take a well-earned break after a long, tiring day of teaching, standing, and instructing. They are truly appreciated by students for their selfless sacrifices and unwavering dedication to supporting their educational journey.')">
